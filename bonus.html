<h1 style="color: seagreen;">Buffalo Bugs Bunny</h1>
<p>Bugs is an anthropomorphic gray and white rabbit or hare who is famous for his flippant, 
insouciant personality. He is also characterized by a Brooklyn accent, his portrayal as a 
trickster, and his catch phrase "Eh...What's up, doc?". Due to Bugs' popularity during the 
golden age of American animation, he became not only an American cultural icon and the official 
mascot of Warner Bros. Entertainment, but also one of the most recognizable characters in the 
world. He can thus be seen in the older Warner Bros. company logos</p>
