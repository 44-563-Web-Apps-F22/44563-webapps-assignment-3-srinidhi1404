<h2>Marley & Me</h2>
<p>This is an American comedy-drama film.The film stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as the 
owners of Marley, a Labrador retriever. The first half of the movie is just a routine life of the couple
who has a dog named Marley. Initially I felt the movie is not bad. But the lines given by the owner when the dog dies 
made me change my decision about the movie: <i>"A dog has no use for fancy cars, big homes, or designer clothes. A water log stick will 
do just fine. A dog doesn't care if your rich or poor, clever or dull, smart or dumb. 
Give him your heart and he'll give you his."</i> </p>
